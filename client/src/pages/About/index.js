Coming from a background in project & process management, systems integration and web development as well as a strong appreciation for continuous learning, I hope to leverage these experiences towards helping underrepresented and vulnerable populations thrive. I believe that long-lasting improvement comes from deliberate and focused attention on critical issues and not from incidental benefits granted by the status quo. I hope to work within an organization striving to strengthen more than just throughput or the bottom line.

If you believe similarly and know of teams using software, academic research or data science to work against obstacles affecting the following groups, please reach out, I would love to talk and learn more!

- The Incarcerated/Released
- The Homeless
- Refugees
- Immigrants
- Sexual Minorities & Gender Non-Conforming Individuals
- The Trans Community and Transgender Individuals
- Addiction-afflicted Individuals
- Substance Abuse Victims
- Fostered Youth
- Endangered Ecosystems & Wildlife
- Endangered Animal Species
- The Mentally Incapacitated
- The Physically Incapacitated`}
