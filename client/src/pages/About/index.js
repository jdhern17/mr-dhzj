    <h1 className="text-center">About Me</h1>
<p>
Coming from a background in project & process management, systems integration and web development as well as a strong appreciation for continuous learning, I hope to leverage these experiences towards helping underrepresented and vulnerable populations thrive. I believe that long-lasting improvement comes from deliberate and focused attention on critical issues and not from incidental benefits granted by the status quo. I hope to work within an organization striving to strengthen more than just throughput or the bottom line.
